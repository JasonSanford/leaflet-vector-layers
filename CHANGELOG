1.0.0
- Initial Release

1.1.0
- Adding PostGIS RESTful Web Service Framework layer (lvector.PRWSF)

1.1.1
- Fixing bug where multiple layers on same map failed when turning them on/off. All instances of lvector.PRWSF were referencing the same _idleListener and _zoomChangeListener objects. Oops.
- Fixing bug where layer.setMap(null) to a layer that was already turned off threw errors.
- Fixing sloppy semis;

1.2.0
- New GIS Cloud layer (gvector.GISCloud)
- DRYing up the code. Moved _processFeatures from individual layers into Layer.js
- Creating two super-layers from which all other layers extend from: GeoJSONLayer and EsriJSONLayer
- Fixed issue where any property change would trigger a symbology change in dynamic, styled layers. We now check to see if the symbology property has changed.
