### About

This library will add Leaflet vector (Point, Polyline, Polygon) layers from multiple geo web services including ArcGIS Server, GeoIQ, Arc2Earth, CartoDB, GIS Cloud, etc.

### Docs + Demos

For details see the [documentation and demos](http://geojason.info/leaflet-vector-layers/) or read a [blog post](http://geojason.info/2012/leaflet-vector-layers/).

### Issues

Since this library and [Google Vector Layers](https://github.com/JasonSanford/google-vector-layers) are closely related and both can do mostly the same things, I'll be keeping up with [issues over there](https://github.com/JasonSanford/google-vector-layers/issues).

That said, if you feel like there's an issue with this library or just want to report things here that's fine too, but check the issues over at Google Vector Layers first to see if it's already come up.
